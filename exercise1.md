# Exercise 11.1

Python will be the language I am using for my new project.

Tools that can be used for CI in Python include the following:

- Linting (pylint, black, isort)
- Testing (pytest)
- Static Type Checking (pyright, mypy)
- Building (poetry)

Tools that can be used to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions include:

- GitLab CI/CD
- Bitbucket Pipelines
- Azure DevOps
- Bamboo
- CircleCI
- TeamCity
- CodeShip

The project I am intending to build with Python would be a simple FastAPI backend application. I envision that the API would not contain many routes and would be developed solely on my own. As such, a cloud-based environment would definitely be better as it is easier to setup and my project likely does not have any special features that are needed to perform the usual CI steps.
